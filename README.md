# Elysium Bot

Elysium Bot is a Discord bot that helps with Disco Elysium based campaigns.

It is backed by a Google Sheet spreadsheet ([template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1smSArAzT9QxktDFgokpl_SvkX7fLbuPbJpEsMZv9XAU/edit?usp=sharing)) with the characters information. Clone the template sheet (File -> Make a copy) and authorize the bot to access it to get started.

‚ö† The channel where you make rolls must match the spreadsheet's tab name, e.g.: if you are planning to execute your commands in `#elysium-campaign` the spreadsheet tab name must be named `elysium-campaign`. You can have more than one simultaneous campaign by using multiple tabs.

## Inviting the bot
